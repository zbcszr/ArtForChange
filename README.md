One of the things I decided to dive into the start of quarantine was web development. This is the product of my "learn by doing" study principle and my attempt to solve real-world problems.

learning objectives: 
- Develop the skills to translate client/customer requirements into a working implementation
- Leverage design patterns to improve the usability
- Practice structuring a database with multiple tables and foreign keys (e.g practice building and querying relationships between tables using common fields)
- Employ best practices for user uploaded content for dynamic websites
